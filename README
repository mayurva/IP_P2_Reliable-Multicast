The data is getting transferred correctly.. but there is a problem with tokenizing. We end up with non null terminated string.
The problem is at line 128 in server util. Comment is added on that line.

At the receiver, data part is now delimited. So segments are now constructed properly. But fails for N = 512, MSS = 999. Maybe possible out of order packets. Need to redirect output to a file to check.
