Worked fine for transfer of both README and 100k.txt to single server with multiple input cases. 

I found few erratic behaviors

1. if window size is 5 and 170 is the last packet and packet from last seg (166 to 170) gets lost the sender goes in infinite loop even after trasfer is completed. This is probably because we dont send ack for last seg in such case...

2. For MSS=500 and n=500 gives the malloc error

3. for Window size=500 and mss=250 the transfer of 100k.txt ended at server though client was still sending. File sizes of 100k.txt and out.txt did not match
